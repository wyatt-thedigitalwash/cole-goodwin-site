//                     gated. The splash is hidden, but they have NOT entered.
//
// These are deliberately distinct. "Entered" is consent; "exempt" is just a
// hidden overlay. Reading the Terms must never count as agreeing to them, so
// this hook reports only the first. A visitor sitting on /legal pre-entry is
// therefore still `false` here, and the cookie banner stays away rather than
// stacking a third prompt on someone who has not seen the site yet. TermsGate
// gives that visitor an explicit way in.
